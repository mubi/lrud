# Changelog

### v0.0.16 (2021/11/4)

**New Features**

- Added fallback behaviour to handle `KeyboardEvent`s that use contain a `keyCode`
  but no `key` property
- Mapped `Backspace` key press to trigger `onBack` handlers.
- Added "Back" key mappings for LG webOS, Samsung Tizen and Sony PlayStation 4
  browser environments.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed build so that this can be used in projects that use webpack 4.

**Other**

- Forked to @mubi/lrud. All previous versions are from @please/lrud


### v0.0.15 (2021/6/17)

**New Features**

- A new prop, `defaultFocusChild`, allows you to specify a particular child's index to receive
  focus. This node is analogous to `defaultFocusColumn` and `defaultFocusRow` for nodes that are
  not grids.

**Bug Fixes**

- Warnings will now log the associated node's focus ID, even when you do not specify one.

### v0.0.14 (2021/6/17)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed an edge case where navigating in a tree with a trap would not behave
  as expected.

### v0.0.13 (2021/6/17)

**Bug Fixes**

- Numerous pointer-related bugs have been squashed
- More props passed into FocusNode can be dynamically updated
- `useSetFocus` no longer works on disabled nodes

### v0.0.12 (2021/6/15)

**New Features**

- `elRef` is now an attribute of the `FocusNode`, allowing you to more easily
  access the underlying DOM node.

**Bug Fixes**

- `useFocusHierarchy` now functions correctly

### v0.0.11 (2020/8/24)

**Bug Fixes**

- Removed a warning that could sometimes happen when disabling focus nodes on mount
- Pointer events now respect disabled nodes

### v0.0.10 (2020/8/21)

**New Features**

- Pointer events now work. Hovering a leaf node focuses it, and clicking a leaf node
  will call `onSelected` as well as make it active.

### v0.0.9 (2020/8/21)

**Breaking Changes**

- The `canReceiveFocusFromArrows` prop has been removed. Focus traps now automatically prevent
  navigation via arrow input.

### v0.0.8 (2020/8/21)

**Bug Fixes**

- Focus traps now respect the `wrapping` property

### v0.0.7 (2020/8/20)

**Bug Fixes**

- Nodes should now become inactive
- Multiple fixes related to focus traps
- Preferred grid columns/rows are now respected every time the grid receives focus

### v0.0.6 (2020/8/17)

**Breaking Changes**

- `useNodeEvents` has been renamed to `useFocusEvents`
- `onFocus`/`onBlur`/`onSelect` have been renamed to avoid collisions with existing React APIs

**New Features**

- Introduces `useActiveNode`
- Grids now support a default column and row

**Other**

- Improved docs

### v0.0.5 (2020/8/12)
