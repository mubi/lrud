# lrud

A React library for managing focus in LRUD applications, forked from [@please/lrud](https://github.com/jamesplease/lrud)

## Motivation

The native focus system that ships with browsers is one-dimensional: users may only move forward and back. Some applications
(typically those that use remote controls or video game controllers) require a two dimensional focus system.

Because of this, it is up to the application to manage its own focus state. That's where this library comes in: it makes working
with two dimensional focus seamless.

## Installation

This module is published to [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/installing-a-package).

Once you are set up and authenticated to the [GitHub Packages npm registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages), install with [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

With npm:
```
npm install @mubi/lrud
```

With yarn
```
yarn add @mubi/lrud
```


This library has the following peer dependencies:

- [`react@^16.8.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)

## Guides

### Basic Setup

Render the `FocusRoot` high up in your application's component tree.

```jsx
import { FocusRoot } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <FocusRoot>
      <AppContents />
    </FocusRoot>
  );
}
```

You may then use FocusNode components to create a focusable elements on the page.

```jsx
import { FocusNode } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function Profile() {
  return <FocusNode className="profile">Profile</FocusNode>;
}
```

This library automatically moves the focus between the FocusNodes as the user inputs
LRUD commands on their keyboard or remote control.

This behavior can be configured through the props of the FocusNode component. To
learn more about those props, refer to the API documentation below.

### Getting Started

The recommended way to familiarize yourself with this library is to begin by looking at the [examples](#examples). The examples
do a great job at demonstrating the kinds of interfaces you can create with this library using little code.

Once you've checked out a few examples you should be in a better position to read through these API docs!

### FAQ

#### What is LRUD?

LRUD is an acronym that stands for left-right-up-down, and it refers to the directional buttons typically found on remotes. In LRUD systems,
input devices usually also have some kind of "submit" button, and, less commonly, a back button.

## API Reference

This section of the documentation describes the library's named exports.

### `<FocusRoot />`

Serves as the root node of a new focus hierarchy. There should only ever be one `FocusRoot` in each application.

All props are optional.

| Prop          | Type    | Default value  | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `orientation` | string  | `'horizontal'` | Whether the children of the root node are arranged horizontally or vertically.                          |
| `wrapping`    | boolean | `false`        | Set to `true` for the navigation to wrap when the user reaches the start or end of the root's children. |

```jsx
import { FocusRoot } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <FocusRoot orientation="vertical">
      <AppContents />
    </FocusRoot>
  );
}
```

### `<FocusNode />`

A [Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) that represents a focusable node in your application.

All props are optional. Example usage appears beneath the props table.

| Prop                        | Type                | Default value    | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |

```jsx
import { FocusNode } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <FocusNode
      elementType="button"
      className="profileBtn"
      onSelected={({ node }) => {
        console.log('The user just selected this profile', node);
      }}>
      Profile
    </FocusNode>
  );
}
```

### `useFocusNode( focusId )`

A [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns the focus node with ID `focusId`. If the node does not exist,
then `null` will be returned instead.

```js
import { useFocusNode } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const navFocusNode = useFocusNode('nav');

  console.log('Is the nav focused?', navFocusNode?.isFocused);
}
```

### `useActiveNode()`

A [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns the active focus node, or `null` if no node is active.

```js
import { useActiveNode } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const activeNode = useActiveNode();

  console.log('The active node:', activeNode);
}
```

### `useSetFocus()`

A [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns the `setFocus` function, which allows you to imperatively set
the focus.

This can be used to:

- override the default navigation behavior of the library
- focus modals or traps
- exit traps

```js
import { useSetFocus } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const setFocus = useSetFocus();

  useEffect(() => {
    setFocus('nav');
  }, []);
}
```

### `useNodeEvents( focusId, events )`

A [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that allows you to tap into a focus nodes' focus lifecycle events. Use this hook when
you need to respond to the focus lifecycle for a node that is not in your current component.

```js
import { useNodeEvents } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function MyComponent() {
  useNodeEvents('nav', {
    focus(navNode) {
      console.log('The nav node is focused', navNode);
    }

    blur(navNode) {
      console.log('The nav node is no longer focused', navNode);
    }
  });
}
```

Each callback receives a single argument, the [focus node](#focusnode).

The available event keys are:

| Event key  | Called when                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `focus`    | the focus node receives focus.      |
| `blur`     | the focus node loses focus.         |
| `active`   | the focus node becomes active.      |
| `inactive` | the focus node is no longer active. |
| `disabled` | the focus node is set as disabled.  |

### `useFocusHierarchy()`

A [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns an array representing the focus hierarchy, which are the nodes
that are currently focused. Each entry in the array is a focus node.

```js
import { useFocusHierarchy } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const focusHierarchy = useFocusHierarchy();

  console.log(focusHierarchy);
  // => [
  //   { focusId: 'root', ... },
  //   { focusId: 'homePage', ... },
  //   { focusId: 'mainNav', ... },
  // ]
}
```

### `useFocusStoreDangerously()`

> ⚠️ Heads up! The FocusStore is an internal API. We strongly discourage you from accessing properties or calling
> methods on the FocusStore directly!

A [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns the
[FocusStore](#focusstore). Typically, you should not need to use this hook.

One use-case for this hook is attaching the `focusStore` to the window when developing, which can be useful
for debugging purposes.

```js
import { useFocusStoreDangerously } from '@mubi/lrud';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const focusStore = useFocusStoreDangerously();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      window.focusStore = focusStore;
    }
  }, []);
}
```

## Interfaces

These are the objects you will encounter when using this library.
